# Guided simulation

This guide goes through a complete `EGS_Mesh` simulation step by step. By the end, you'll be ready to conduct your own simulations. Along the way we'll cover: 

* Fundamental EGSnrc and `EGS_Mesh` concepts
* Gmsh basics
* Running EGSnrc simulations
* Viewing `EGS_Mesh` simulation results in Paraview

## Prerequisites
To follow along, you'll need the following software: 
* EGSnrc with `EGS_Mesh` library support and the `mevegs` user code
* [Gmsh](https://gmsh.info/#Download)
* [Paraview](https://www.paraview.org/download/)

With that, you're ready to [start!](./input_mesh.md)
