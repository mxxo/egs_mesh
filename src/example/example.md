# Example simulation

`EGS_Mesh` simulations have three steps:
1. Create an input mesh file for your geometry, 
2. Write an `egsinp` file for your simulation, and
3. Run the simulation and view the results.

This guide walks you through each step and by the end, you'll have conducted a complete `EGS_Mesh` simulation from start to finish.

We'll cover: 
* Fundamental EGSnrc and `EGS_Mesh` concepts, 
* Gmsh basics, 
* Running EGSnrc simulations, and 
* Viewing `EGS_Mesh` simulation results in Paraview.

## Prerequisites
To follow along, you'll need the following software: 
* EGSnrc with `EGS_Mesh` library support
* [Gmsh](https://gmsh.info/#Download)
* [Paraview](https://www.paraview.org/download/)
